	abstract = {The term 'extended-spectrum beta-lactamase' (ESBL), initially 'extended-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase', was first coined for derivatives of TEM and SHV enzymes able to hydrolyse oxyimino-cephalosporins. These all belonged to beta-lactamase functional group 2be. Subsequently, the term has been stretched to include: (i) enzymes with spectra similar to those of TEM and SHV mutants but derived from other sources, e.g., the CTX-M and VEB types; (ii) TEM and SHV mutants with borderline ESBL activity, e.g., TEM-12; and (iii) various beta-lactamases conferring wider resistance than their parent types but not meeting the definition for group 2be, e.g., OXA derivatives and mutant AmpC types with increased activity against cefepime. It seems best-and pragmatic-that the term 'ESBL' retains its broad modern usage, but that should always be accompanied by mention of the enzyme's family as, e.g., in 'TEM ESBL' or 'OXA ESBL', not as a sole moniker.},

	doi = {10.1128/AAC.01009-09},
	abstract = {Two classification schemes for beta-lactamases are currently in use. The molecular classification is based on the amino acid sequence and divides beta-lactamases into class A, C, and D enzymes which utilize serine for beta-lactam hydrolysis and class B metalloenzymes which require divalent zinc ions for substrate hydrolysis. The functional classification scheme updated herein is based on the 1995 proposal by Bush et al. (K. Bush, G. A. Jacoby, and A. A. Medeiros, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:1211-1233, 1995). It takes into account substrate and inhibitor profiles in an attempt to group the enzymes in ways that can be correlated with their phenotype in clinical isolates. Major groupings generally correlate with the more broadly based molecular classification. The updated system includes group 1 (class C) cephalosporinases; group 2 (classes A and D) broad-spectrum, inhibitor-resistant, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and serine carbapenemases; and group 3 metallo-beta-lactamases. Several new subgroups of each of the major groups are described, based on specific attributes of individual enzymes. A list of attributes is also suggested for the description of a new beta-lactamase, including the requisite microbiological properties, substrate and inhibitor profiles, and molecular sequence data that provide an adequate characterization for a new beta-lactam-hydrolyzing enzyme.},

	abstract = {The genomic diversity of microbes is commonly parameterized as single nucleotide polymorphisms relative to a reference genome of a well-characterized, but arbitrary, isolate. However, any reference genome contains only a fraction of the microbial pangenome, the total set of genes observed in a given species. Reference-based approaches are thus blind to the dynamics of the accessory genome, as well as variation within gene order and copy number. With the wide-spread usage of long-read sequencing, the number of high-quality, complete genome assemblies has increased dramatically. Traditional computational approaches towards whole-genome analysis either scale poorly with the number of genomes, or treat genomes as dissociated “bags of genes”, and thus are not suited for this new era. Here, we present PanGraph, a Julia-based library and command line interface for aligning whole genomes into a graph. Each genome is represented as an undirected path along vertices, which in turn, encapsulate homologous multiple sequence alignments. The resultant data structure succinctly summarizes population-level nucleotide and structural polymorphisms and can be exported into a several common formats for either downstream analysis or immediate visualization.},

	abstract = {A Swedish patient of Indian origin traveled to New Delhi, India, and acquired a urinary tract infection caused by a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain that typed to the sequence type 14 complex. The isolate, Klebsiella pneumoniae 05-506, was shown to possess a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) but was negative for previously known MBL genes. Gene libraries and amplification of class 1 integrons revealed three resistance-conferring regions; the first contained bla(CMY-4) flanked by ISEcP1 and blc. The second region of 4.8 kb contained a complex class 1 integron with the gene cassettes arr-2, a new erythromycin esterase gene; ereC; aadA1; and cmlA7. An intact ISCR1 element was shown to be downstream from the qac/sul genes. The third region consisted of a new MBL gene, designated bla(NDM-1), flanked on one side by K. pneumoniae DNA and a truncated IS26 element on its other side. The last two regions lie adjacent to one another, and all three regions are found on a 180-kb region that is easily transferable to recipient strains and that confers resistance to all antibiotics except fluoroquinolones and colistin. NDM-1 shares very little identity with other MBLs, with the most similar MBLs being VIM-1/VIM-2, with which it has only 32.4\% identity. As well as possessing unique residues near the active site, NDM-1 also has an additional insert between positions 162 and 166 not present in other MBLs. NDM-1 has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, is monomeric, and can hydrolyze all beta-lactams except aztreonam. Compared to VIM-2, NDM-1 displays tighter binding to most cephalosporins, in particular, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and cephalothin (cefalotin), and also to the penicillins. NDM-1 does not bind to the carbapenems as tightly as IMP-1 or VIM-2 and turns over the carbapenems at a rate similar to that of VIM-2. In addition to K. pneumoniae 05-506, bla(NDM-1) was found on a 140-kb plasmid in an Escherichia coli strain isolated from the patient's feces, inferring the possibility of in vivo conjugation. The broad resistance carried on these plasmids is a further worrying development for India, which already has high levels of antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {The mobile resistance gene blaNDM encodes the NDM enzyme which hydrolyses carbapenems, a class of antibiotics used to treat some of the most severe bacterial infections. The blaNDM gene is globally distributed across a variety of Gram-negative bacteria on multiple plasmids, typically located within highly recombining and transposon-rich genomic regions, which leads to the dynamics underlying the global dissemination of blaNDM to remain poorly resolved. Here, we compile a dataset of over 6000 bacterial genomes harbouring the blaNDM gene, including 104 newly generated PacBio hybrid assemblies from clinical and livestock-associated isolates across China. We develop a computational approach to track structural variants surrounding blaNDM, which allows us to identify prevalent genomic contexts, mobile genetic elements, and likely events in the gene’s global spread. We estimate that blaNDM emerged on a Tn125 transposon before 1985, but only reached global prevalence around a decade after its first recorded observation in 2005. The Tn125 transposon seems to have played an important role in early plasmid-mediated jumps of blaNDM, but was overtaken in recent years by other elements including IS26-flanked pseudo-composite transposons and Tn3000. We found a strong association between blaNDM-carrying plasmid backbones and the sampling location of isolates. This observation suggests that the global dissemination of the blaNDM gene was primarily driven by successive between-plasmid transposon jumps, with far more restricted subsequent plasmid exchange, possibly due to adaptation of plasmids to their specific bacterial hosts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) is predominantly caused by Escherichia coli, which has increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the United States (US)-community level. As uUTI is often treated empirically, assessing AMR is challenging, and there are limited contemporary data characterizing period prevalence in the US.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of AMR using Becton, Dickinson and Company Insights Research Database (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, US) data collected 2011-2019. Thirty-day, nonduplicate Escherichia coli urine isolates from US female outpatients (aged ≥12 years) were included. Isolates were evaluated for nonsusceptibility (intermediate/resistant) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, or nitrofurantoin, and assessed for extended-spectrum β-lactamase production (ESBL+) and for ≥2 or ≥3 drug-resistance phenotypes. Generalized estimating equations were used to model AMR trends over time and by US census region.
RESULTS: Among 1 513 882 E. coli isolates, the overall prevalence of isolates nonsusceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and nitrofurantoin was 25.4\%, 21.1\%, and 3.8\%, respectively. Among the isolates, 6.4\% were ESBL+, 14.4\% had ≥2 drug-resistance phenotypes, and 3.8\% had ≥3. Modeling demonstrated a relative average yearly increase of 7.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.2-8.2\%) for ESBL+ isolates and 2.7\% (95\% CI, 2.2-3.2\%) for ≥3 drug-phenotypes (both P {\textless} .0001). Modeling also demonstrated significant variation in AMR prevalence between US census regions (P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Period prevalence of AMR among US outpatient urine-isolated E. coli was high, and for multidrug-resistance phenotypes increased during the study period with significant variation between census regions. Knowledge of regional AMR rates helps inform empiric treatment of community-onset uUTI and highlights the AMR burden to physicians.},

In recent years there has been an increased incidence and prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), enzymes that hydrolyze and cause resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam. The majority of ESBLs are derived from the widespread broad-spectrum β-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1. There are also new families of ESBLs, including the CTX-M and OXA-type enzymes as well as novel, unrelated β-lactamases. Several different methods for the detection of ESBLs in clinical isolates have been suggested. While each of the tests has merit, none of the tests is able to detect all of the ESBLs encountered. ESBLs have become widespread throughout the world and are now found in a significant percentage of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in certain countries. They have also been found in other Enterobacteriaceae strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains expressing these β-lactamases will present a host of therapeutic challenges as we head into the 21st century.},

	abstract = {Penicillin and related beta-lactams comprise one of our oldest and most widely used antibiotic therapies. These drugs have long been known to target enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that build the bacterial cell wall. Investigating the downstream consequences of target inhibition and how they contribute to the lethal action of these important drugs, we demonstrate that beta-lactams do more than just inhibit the PBPs as is commonly believed. Rather, they induce a toxic malfunctioning of their target biosynthetic machinery involving a futile cycle of cell wall synthesis and degradation, thereby depleting cellular resources and bolstering their killing activity. Characterization of this mode of action additionally revealed a quality control function for enzymes that cleave bonds in the cell wall matrix. The results thus provide insight into the mechanism of cell wall assembly and suggest how best to interfere with the process for future antibiotic development.},

Analysis of that phylogeny shows that much of the diversity is the result of ancient events and that the OXA genes were mobilized from chromosomes to plasmids on at least two independent occasions that occurred millions of years ago.

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a global challenge that impacts all pharmaceutically used antibiotics. The origin of the genes associated with this resistance is of significant importance to our understanding of the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in pathogens. A growing body of evidence implicates environmental organisms as reservoirs of these resistance genes; however, the role of anthropogenic use of antibiotics in the emergence of these genes is controversial. We report a screen of a sample of the culturable microbiome of Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, in a region of the cave that has been isolated for over 4 million years. We report that, like surface microbes, these bacteria were highly resistant to antibiotics; some strains were resistant to 14 different commercially available antibiotics. Resistance was detected to a wide range of structurally different antibiotics including daptomycin, an antibiotic of last resort in the treatment of drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Enzyme-mediated mechanisms of resistance were also discovered for natural and semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics via glycosylation and through a kinase-mediated phosphorylation mechanism. Sequencing of the genome of one of the resistant bacteria identified a macrolide kinase encoding gene and characterization of its product revealed it to be related to a known family of kinases circulating in modern drug resistant pathogens. The implications of this study are significant to our understanding of the prevalence of resistance, even in microbiomes isolated from human use of antibiotics. This supports a growing understanding that antibiotic resistance is natural, ancient, and hard wired in the microbial pangenome.},

Gardnerella vaginalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that G. vaginalis Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas S. saprophyticus Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of S. saprophyticus infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals.

	abstract = {β-Lactam antibiotics have been widely used as therapeutic agents for the past 70 years, resulting in emergence of an abundance of β-lactam-inactivating β-lactamases. Although penicillinases in Staphylococcus aureus challenged the initial uses of penicillin, β-lactamases are most important in Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in enteric and nonfermentative pathogens, where collectively they confer resistance to all β-lactam-containing antibiotics. Critical β-lactamases are those enzymes whose genes are encoded on mobile elements that are transferable among species. Major β-lactamase families include plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC cephalosporinases, and carbapenemases now appearing globally, with geographic preferences for specific variants. CTX-M enzymes include the most common ESBLs that are prevalent in all areas of the world. In contrast, KPC serine carbapenemases are present more frequently in the Americas, the Mediterranean countries, and China, whereas NDM metallo-β-lactamases are more prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and Eastern Europe. As selective pressure from β-lactam use continues, multiple β-lactamases per organism are increasingly common, including pathogens carrying three different carbapenemase genes. These organisms may be spread throughout health care facilities as well as in the community, warranting close attention to increased infection control measures and stewardship of the β-lactam-containing drugs in an effort to control selection of even more deleterious pathogens.},

Since the discovery of benzylpenicillin in the 1920s, thousands of new penicillin derivatives and related β-lactam classes of cephalosporins, cephamycins, monobactams, and carbapenems have been discovered. Each new class of β-lactam has been developed either to increase the spectrum of activity to include additional bacterial species or to address specific resistance mechanisms that have arisen in the targeted bacterial population. Resistance to β-lactams is primarily because of bacterially produced β-lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze the β-lactam ring, thereby inactivating the drug. The newest effort to circumvent resistance is the development of novel broad-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitors that work against many problematic β-lactamases, including cephalosporinases and serine-based carbapenemases, which severely limit therapeutic options. This work provides a comprehensive overview of β-lactam antibiotics that are currently in use, as well as a look ahead to several new compounds that are in the development pipeline., The most widely used antibiotics are the β-lactams (e.g., penicillin). Efforts to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors of bacterially produced β-lactamase enzymes may curb resistance to this important class of antibiotics.},
