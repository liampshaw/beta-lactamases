Error in rule run_fasttree:

    input: fasta/CTX-M.refined.aln

    shell:
        FastTree -nt -gtr fasta/CTX-M.refined.aln > trees/CTX-M.refined.tre
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job run_fasttree since they might be corrupted:
trees/CTX-M.refined.tre
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
